# GDB-Graph-Extension
<strong>Made By: Arya Amin, Aryan Thakur, Sanchit, Sagar</strong><br>
An interactive browser based extension for gdb, using gdbâ€™s Python API and Cytoscape Framework of JavaScript. The extension will be able to pick up Graph Data Structures from the program state whenever gdb pauses at a breakpoint and render these in a browser, so that the user can interact with the graph, browse through data stored in the nodes, look at the graph structure, move the graph around a bit, and collapse a group of nodes into one single node, etc.
