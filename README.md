# GDB-Graph-Extension

An interactive browser based extension for gdb, using gdb’s Python API and Cytoscape Framework of JavaScript. The extension will be able to pick up Graph Data Structures from the program state whenever gdb pauses at a breakpoint and render these in a browser, so that the user can interact with the graph, browse through the data stored in the nodes, look at the graph structure, move the graph around a bit, and collapse a group of nodes into one single node, etc.
